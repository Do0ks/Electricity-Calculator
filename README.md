# Electricity-Calculator

<b>Discription:</b>  
A quick and easy command-based electricity calculator that calculates watts or kilowatts to amps and factors the ambient correction factors based on the Ambient Correction Factors in NEC Table 310.15(B)(2)(a) then yields the Amps, along with the corrected cable size to safely run.  
(It was a free project for work done in a hour.. if you cant tell lol)
